1. **Install Python version 3.11 or above on your system.**

2. **Clone the project directory to your local system.**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - **On Windows:**

      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - **On Ubuntu or Mac:**

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. **Go to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

6. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository and `<repository-directory>` with the name of the directory created by the clone command.

3. **Save the file**:
   Save the `README.md` file.

Recommendations
Asynchronous Processing:

Celery: Celery is a distributed task queue that allows you to run long-running tasks asynchronously. You can offload the task of fetching comments from the external API to Celery workers, allowing the main application to remain responsive.
AsyncIO: For I/O-bound tasks, using asyncio in Python can help you make non-blocking HTTP requests and process multiple requests concurrently.
Batch Processing:
Instead of fetching all comments at once, fetch them in smaller batches and process each batch independently. This reduces memory usage and improves responsiveness.
Caching:

Redis: Use Redis to cache API responses or partial results to avoid redundant API calls. This can significantly reduce the number of requests made to the external API.
Serverless Functions:
AWS Lambda: Use AWS Lambda functions to handle parts of the fetching and processing in parallel. This can be especially useful if the task can be broken down into smaller, independent units of work.
Data Streaming:

Apache Kafka: For continuous data ingestion and processing, consider using Kafka to stream data and process it in real-time.
